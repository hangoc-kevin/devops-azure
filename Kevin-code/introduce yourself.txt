Hi everybody ,
My name: Ha Nhu Ngoc, nickname: Kevin.ha
I studied electronics and telecommunications at Hanoi Polytechnic University. I am currently working as a devops engineer and sa .
My work is related to engineering and IT, I love it and am passionate about it.
I am a person who blends the environment and skills, ie adapting to the environment very quickly. I am passionate about technology, exploring new things, so I chose to study my favorite field (telecommunications and IT). In my free time, I read books, listen to music, eat, drink coffee with friends. When I was in junior high school, I liked to study literature, I was more passionate about art, I wish I liked lawyers. But in high school I was passionate about computers , science and technology . At first I practiced pascal , C ++ , I loved it . After that, I worked as a programmer and became a devops engineer. I like to experience a dynamic and creative environment. there gave me a lot of experience .
My family was born in a rural area, 200km away from the capital. When I went to the capital to study, I brought many dreams and ambitions with me. Exposure to technology, the cloud gives me more experiences, as well as living with passion. I know your company has many investment projects in the world , and works with technology > I am very happy for that , I am passionate , want to do more things , contribute to bring technology value , spread radiate. You know , I have experienced poor country like Mozambique , where they don't have internet , mobile network . When we provide mobile , network , wallet service , they are happy . We see the joy and pride of Vietnamese people. I hope that if I have the opportunity to participate in this project, I will contribute to bringing the value of technology to reach and reach higher.
Thank you !
